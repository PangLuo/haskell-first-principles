{-|
Modifications compared to the code in the book include
- shorter words
- only incorrect guesses count towards the guess limit:
  * the fourth argument of Puzzle indicates the number of failed attempts
    so far
  * once the number of failed attempts reaches failLimit, you lose
  * a guessed character that has already been guessed before isn't regarded
    as a failed attempt
